// walks every KV namespace, so these settings ride along in a backup too.

// the existing synchronous `localStorage.getItem(...)` call sites read, and KV
// is a mirror behind it. On boot we pull the mirror down; on every write we
// push the key up. No new read API, no call-site changes.

// them was destroyed, and the next boot had nothing left to restore.
