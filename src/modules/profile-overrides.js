// store and keyed by profile id.

// These used to live only on the profile record's `metadata` map. Decaid re-seeds
// its bundled profiles on every boot and *replaces* that map with
// {source, filename} whenever the bundled copy changes (profile_controller.dart
// _loadDefaultProfilesIfNeeded), so a Decaid update silently wiped the user's
// numbers for every default profile. KV is the app's own Hive box: nothing but
// this skin writes it, it survives an app update, and Decaid's backup export
// walks every KV namespace so it rides along in a backup.
//
// Reads stay where they always were — profileManager/profile_selector read
// `record.metadata` — because loadAvailableProfiles() folds these values onto the
// cached records. Metadata is still honoured as the base, so numbers saved by an
// older build keep working until the next edit moves them to KV.
